# OSCP

These are my OSCP notes and exploits I wrote while preparing.

## OSCP-Cheatsheet usage

The cheatsheet is meant to be as searchable as possible.
A such you have the following options to search for an entry:

1. You can search for a known **toolname**:
	- example: "gobuster"
	- example: "rpcclient"
2. You can search for the targeted **service**:
	- example "service: smb"
	- example "service: ftp"
3. You can search for **MITRE-tactics**:
	- example "tactics: enumeration"
	- example "tactics: lateral_movement"
4. You can search for tool **suites**:
	- example: "suites: impacket"
	- example: "suites: powershell_empire"

Some parts of this document still need some work. Feel free to submit a PR.
